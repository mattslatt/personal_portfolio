Dissertation: 

# [Project 1: Music Genre Analysis](https://github.com/mattslatt/spotify)
* Visualized genre time-series data with matplotlib and quantified changes with hypothesis testing
* Engineered novel features to recommend relatively unknown artists according to user input

# [Project 2: Podcast Topic Mining](https://github.com/mattslatt/podcast_reviews)
* Cleaned and vectorized review text to train Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector models for sentiment prediction, optimized for F1 score with minority class oversampling
* Highlighted podcast topics most likely to incur positive or negative audience responses based on text feature importance

# [Project 3: Fraudulent Transaction Detection](https://github.com/mattslatt/podcast_reviews)
* Collaborated with a team of four  to build and deploy an XGBoost model that flags fraudulent charges based on transaction metadata
* Engineered location-based features and resolved missing data by imputing values with linear regression to boost model performance
